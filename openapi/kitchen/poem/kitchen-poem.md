# How to Clean the Kitchen: A Rhyming Guide

Welcome to the kitchen, where the mess likes to play,\
Let's tidy it up, hip-hip-hooray!

First, grab a sponge and some soap,\
With a smile on your face and a heart full of hope.\
Scrub those dishes, let them gleam,\
In a sparkly kitchen, we all dream!

Wipe the counters, left to right,\
Make them shine, oh so bright.\
Spills and crumbs, they have no chance,\
In our clean kitchen dance.

Sweep the floor, don’t miss a spot,\
Under the table, give it a shot.\
Banish the dirt, the dust, the grime,\
A clean kitchen is simply sublime.

Empty the trash, don’t delay,\
Take it out and save the day.\
Replace the bag, fresh and new,\
A simple task, but crucial too.

Fridge and pantry, check them out,\
Throw away what's gone bad, no doubt.\
Organize and make it neat,\
A tidy kitchen can’t be beat!

Microwave and oven, they need love,\
Clean them well, give them a shove.\
No more splatters, no more mess,\
A sparkling clean, we must confess.

Now you’re done, take a bow,\
You’ve cleaned the kitchen, and here’s how.\
With a bit of effort and a lot of cheer,\
You’ve made the kitchen pristine and full of fear!
